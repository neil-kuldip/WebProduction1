    <h3>Rachel Greene - Web Work: A History of Internet Art</h3>

    <p>
        I found Rachel Greene's “Web Work: A History of Internet Art,” to be an interesting read, despite having to reread the article several times. 
        Before this, I had an idea of how primitive the Internet was but didn't have an idea of how creative expression and communication played a role 
        in this. To think that the internet was a place for non-marginalized communities to interact and express their views on society and interests amazes me. 
        It's a thing to consider the way the internet is now with fear of mining personal data for bigger corporations versus how it was a place for the average 
        enthusiast to belong. I especially loved how Heath Bunting created the King's Cross Phone-In event. It perfectly shows how the internet expanded to make 
        events that would have otherwise been hard to organize. It shows how net.art is given value not only by the context it stems from but the community it's 
        fostered in. Some interesting parts like the Jodi.org projects that brought on a new level of interaction with the users. The VNS Matrix and other sites 
        made the internet its own kind of expressive platform for media and displaying unique human traits, ideas, issues, and concepts. From this, I get the 
        feeling that these developments needed to happen to make what the internet is today in our lives, even with the ever changing landscape.

    <h3>Andrew Dickson - With Galleries Closed, a Moment for Net Artists to Shine</h3>
    
    <p>
        After reading Greene's article, I wasn't surprised by the content of Andrew Dickson's “With Galleries Closed, a Moment for Net Artists to Shine.” The pandemic 
        in many ways has closed many forms of in-person entertainment through media. Although I rarely visit museums due to time, it was surprising to see how net.art 
        makes a reappearance in mainstream media through the course of events. I understand how many would not get the hype of net.art since it was enjoyed by the 
        audience connected to the communities, but the fact that curators devoted parts of museums to them now is amazing. To see artists who were years ahead of their 
        time in terms of online creative expression being recognized is a sight to behold. I love Sebastian Schmeig's Gallery.Delivery since I personally use food 
        delivery services and understand the cool reference for artwork. For the most part, this NYT article has shown me how the pandemic gave some positive light to 
        previously shadowed trends and might inspire a new generation to add to the mix.

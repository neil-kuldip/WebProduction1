        <h3>As We May Think </h3>
        <p> Through the lens of Vannevar Bush's perspective, I find myself agreeing on the general concept that science should advance 
          to maintain and further develop the collective knowledge acquired so far. At this contemporary moment, we are bound by the 
          current methods of research and analysis. These same old methods are not evolving at the same pace that the mechanized technology 
          is going. However, I do think of the complexities mentioned of automating the associative trails humans do to draw connections. 
          While machine learning has proved to be efficient in trying to mimic the way we connect the dots, I find that we would be pushed 
          to an extent of losing that part of humanity to this development. While automating the selection process may have its feats of 
          allowing us to direct more attention to bigger things, it's also a thing to note of the frontiers we are reaching for examining 
          our physical world. Despite this I am all for this current route of development, if it means that research and understanding can 
          be widely understood. We already have more access to the world at our fingertips, imagine the potential of this development to 
          open our minds to possibilities previously sealed from us.

        <h3>Long Live the Web</h3>
        <p>
          Reading about Tim Berners-Lee's appeal to keep the World Wide Web feels paramount relative to other things to keep evolving our 
          world and the way we thrive in it. From my view as a digital native, I find myself fortunate to have grown up with this technology 
          and have it become an essential utility in my everyday life. It was surprising how specific Berner-Lee and the World Wide Web Consortium 
          intended the principles of the web when launched. It amazed me how much I take for granted the ability to search, interact, and contribute 
          to this greater interconnected network through this application. I remember years ago during the previous presidency how the decision of 
          net neutrality was approaching, but didn't fully grasp the gravity of the principles being discarded. The web has not only propelled the 
          twenty-first century to a new era, but it also encouraged change on a grander scale with more barriers between people being dismantled. As 
          for basic human rights, I do agree that the web is still in a long ongoing stage where our federal laws and policies are struggling to keep 
          up with these developments. With that, I couldn't be more in agreement that the web needs to be protected and maintained so that our future 
          and those who inhabit it can keep the wheel turning and reap the benefits.
